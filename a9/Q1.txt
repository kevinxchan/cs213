OBSERVATION: the runtime increases linearly with number of blocks inputted. For every factor of 10 numBlocks is increased by, the runtime is increased by the same factor.

EXPLANATION: in run(), every time a disk read is scheduled, the disk waits until the read has been completed before handling it. Thus only one read is done at a time, resulting in linear time.
