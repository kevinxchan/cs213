In list.c when list_delete_element() is called, it does not keep track of any pointers pointing to the list nodes and frees up the memory associated with each node's data and the node itself upon deletion. Therefore, in main() when list_delete is called, followed by a call to tree_ordered_suffix_print(), all the trees pointers will be pointing to freed memory - this is the dangling pointer problem.
